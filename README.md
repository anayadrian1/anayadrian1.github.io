## Introduction

I am a quick visual learner with critical thinking skills who works well with others and am currently going to attend the Deep Dive Coding Java + Android Bootcamp. My plans upon course completion is to hopefully get a job or internship to advance my skills in computer science and obtain a career in this field.
