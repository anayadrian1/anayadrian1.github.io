## Introduction

Hello! My name is Adrian Anaya. I am a 26-year-old hard-working graduate student of the University of New Mexico with a Bachelor's of Business Administration and working towards a Master's in Cybersecurity. I am also former personal injury legal assistant experienced in independently managing a myriad of client files through all stages, except litigation, for a personal injury claim with a certification from the Java + Android Deep Dive Coding Program with CNM Ingenuity where I worked  to develop skills in front end and back end software development to create applications for Android using Java and XML, while utilizing database languages such as SQL. I want to advance my skills in the information technology and software development industries and further my education within the fields.
